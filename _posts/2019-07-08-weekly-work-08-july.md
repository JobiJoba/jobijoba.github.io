description: Progression of the second week of my Thai learning. A lot of good resources
  to learn Thai

---
Time to do a wrap up on my progression this week.

I've mainly work on this website for my Thai by adding **6 Describe a picture article**.

* [House](https://mythainote.com/describe-a-picture-house "house")
* [Train](https://mythainote.com/describe-a-picture-train "Train")
* [Chilli](https://mythainote.com/describe-a-picture-chilli "Chilli")
* [People](https://mythainote.com/describe-a-picture-people "People")
* [Takraw ball](https://mythainote.com/describe-a-picture-takraw-ball "Takraw ball")
* [Dog](https://mythainote.com/describe-a-picture-dog "Dog")

This website is not really **live** yet. I'm still doing some **fine tuning** here and there. I also want to see what kind of **rhythm** I can have.

I miss a day :< I did **6 articles** instead of 7 (The goal was to make one article a day).

I think that **5 articles a week** will be a good number, leaving me 2 day off and also 2 days to find **new ideas** and **develop the website**.

I've watched an interesting YouTube video about language learning which I recommend to everyone : [How to Acquire any language NOT learn it!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=illApgaLgGA&t=1s "How to Acquire any language NOT learn it!"). 

It's funny because one of his "**main method**" is to take magazines or children books and let a native speaker describe/speaks about the images and or story. It's not that far from my idea of Describe a picture daily here on the blog ^^

I didn't work on the Thai-note website to improve my keyboard skill this week. I'll have to work twice as much next week on it!

I'm looping on a Thai music this days : [เรื่องที่ขอ - LULA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2nIHSgQ2Bs "Lula") - I love it, really nice song (has been very popular in Thailand when I was there). 

To next week!
