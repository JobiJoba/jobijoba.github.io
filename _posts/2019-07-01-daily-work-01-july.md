This week, I've worked mainly on [http://thai-notes.com/typing/typingtrainers.shtml](http://thai-notes.com/typing/typingtrainers.shtml "http://thai-notes.com/typing/typingtrainers.shtml") to master the Thai keyboard. I've reached the lesson 25 so far but before continuing I'm trying to master the previous letter so this week I'm repeating the word lesson (For the people interested : 4-8-12-15-17-21-25).

It becomes harder and harder at the end because of the use of SHIFT and some of the letter are on the numbers but feeling quite good with the other letter right now.

I'm using my [app (only available on Android right now)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joba.readthaifun&hl=en "app read write speak thai") daily, playing the games inside (The find correct translations on sentences and words). 5 to 10 minutes everyday to get some vocabulary and play the sound.

I've worked also on the new concept for this blog which will be ''Describe an image''.

Everyday, I'll post an image and try to make sentence about the image. Every validated sentences (corrected by someone, or when we are sure it's correct) I'll upload the sound of it.

Everyone can participate to it, in fact, more people participate to it, more sentence we can discover or validate together.

Except from that, I'm still watching some YouTube video in Thai (mainly recipes to familiarize myself with the Thai language and some vocabulary).

If you are interested here is a good [YouTube channel ครัวพิศพิไล](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxokPwBs3cvfyNA_BaKBpbw "YouTube channel")
