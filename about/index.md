description: How and why I created MyThaiNote and a small description of myself.

---
I created **MyThaiNote** because I'm not studying Thai every day ! 

For me, one of the **core principles** of learning a language is to work on it **every day** even if it's only 10 minutes!

So creating this website is for me a **challenge** (create at least a blog post every day) and at the same time a simple platform to host online all my **work on the language**.

Currently, I'm working without a teacher, so putting my work online allow me also to be corrected by the community on what I'm doing.  

As an example, the **Describe a picture** section can be **enriched** by the **community** a lot! feel free to send me **sentences** that you think will be matching the picture, or say "Hey that sentence should use that word instead of that word, etc..."

**About myself,**

I'm a **mobile developer** and I developed the applications [Read Write Speak Thai on Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joba.readthaifun&hl=en "Read Write Speak Thai Android") - you can also visit the [website](https://readthaiapp.github.io/ "Read Thai App Website"). The iOS version had to be removed (because of an account switch and I couldn't transfer the app) but I'll try to upload a new version soon. 

I've been living in **Thailand** from 3 years (total count, travel in between etc) and I'm originally from Belgium. I mainly spent my time in **Chiang Mai**!
