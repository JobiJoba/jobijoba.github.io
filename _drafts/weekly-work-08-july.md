Time to do a wrap up on my progression this week.

I've mainly work on this website for my Thai by adding 6 Describe a picture article.

* [House](https://mythainote.com/describe-a-picture-house "house")
* [Train](https://mythainote.com/describe-a-picture-train "Train")
* [Chilli](https://mythainote.com/describe-a-picture-chilli "Chilli")
* [People](https://mythainote.com/describe-a-picture-people "People")
* [Takraw ball](https://mythainote.com/describe-a-picture-takraw-ball "Takraw ball")
* [Dog](https://mythainote.com/describe-a-picture-dog "Dog")

This website is not really live yet. I'm still doing some fine tuning here and there. I also want to see what kind of rhythm I can have.

I miss a day for example I did 6 articles instead of 7 (The goal was to make one article a day). 

I think that 5 articles a week will be a good number, leaving me 2 day off and also 2 days to find new ideas and develop the website.
