description: Progression of the second week of my Thai learning. A lot of good resource
  to learn Thai

---
Time to do a wrap up on my progression this week.

I've mainly work on this website for my Thai by adding **6 Describe a picture article**.

* [House](https://mythainote.com/describe-a-picture-house "house")
* [Train](https://mythainote.com/describe-a-picture-train "Train")
* [Chilli](https://mythainote.com/describe-a-picture-chilli "Chilli")
* [People](https://mythainote.com/describe-a-picture-people "People")
* [Takraw ball](https://mythainote.com/describe-a-picture-takraw-ball "Takraw ball")
* [Dog](https://mythainote.com/describe-a-picture-dog "Dog")

This website is not really **live** yet. I'm still doing some **fine tuning** here and there. I also want to see what kind of **rhythm** I can have.

I miss a day for example I did **6 articles** instead of 7 (The goal was to make one article a day). 

I think that **5 articles a week** will be a good number, leaving me 2 day off and also 2 days to find **new ideas** and **develop the website**.
