Welcome to that new series of stuff that I want to do to improve my Thai.

Every day I'm going to post a picture and try to describe it in Thai.

Feel free to write a comment down the page with your sentences!

# Verified sentences

This sections will have the verified sentences, the one we are sure are correct in Thai, and so, I'll add the sound to it (so we can also work on the pronunciation).

#### This is a house.

<span class="blue">นี่คือบ้าน</span>

# Unverified sentences

This sections will have all the draft sentences, I'm still not sure that everything is correct or even the sentences are just still in plain english and need to be translated.

#### The house have a chimney and a red roof.

#### The door is brown.
